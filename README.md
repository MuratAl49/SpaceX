# SpaceX
In this project, using the SpaceX data showing all the details about each flight regarding the launch site, booster type, payloads, success criteria etc. we tried to find out what combination of these would be the better option to try the next one that is Falcon9.
Data shows CCAFS LC40 and KSC LC sites were most successful than others. In general Booster FT outperformed others at all payloads. Others also performed well in certain payloads.Launch site locations are most likely similar regarding their neighborhood. They are close to the coast and far from the highly populated areas.
In this project, we pulled the raw data and organized it using some cleaning, sorting, normalization tools. Based on a new dataset that contains only significant terms we have applied data analysis, visualization and ML algorythms for prediction to obtain a better insight on future launches.
